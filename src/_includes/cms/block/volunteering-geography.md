{{# TODO Comments from Comms
Geographic distribution 
We say we want to make sure the volunteering team is representative of the whole of Bradford
but as we only have age I think this line needs to come out or change the copy so it speaks
more about the spread across the district and not use the word representative as that could
read as demographics. 

Replaced with "We want be make sure the volunteers are drawn from across the whole Bradford area."

{{# TODO Comments from Comms
I think we need to explain why we only have 698 postcodes, when will we have the rest?
#}}
We want be make sure the volunteers are drawn from across the whole Bradford area.
The maps below are produced based on the address details that our volunteers provide during
the <b>Sign up</b> checkpoint. At the moment, have verified address details for
<strong>{{ Math.round(100 * known_address / total_volunteers) }}%</strong>
({{ known_address }}) of our volunteers. The remaining volunteers have either not yet completed the required forms or have provided postcodes that we don't recognise and that we're manually checking and correcting.

Our volunteer area co-ordinators are working to recruit more volunteers from across the region, and also helping make sure that the already registered volunteers have filled in their forms correctly.
