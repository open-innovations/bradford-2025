Volunteers are going to help Bradford 2025 deliver an incredible year of culture. There are many ways to get involved.

We're appointing ambassadors for one of Bradford’s diverse neighbourhoods – from Bingley to Barkerend, Ilkley to Idle, Keighley to Clayton. Volunteers will act as the friendly faces of Bradford 2025, meeting and greeting the public at our events. Some of our volunteers will be helping out behind the scenes, making sure our events run smoothly.
