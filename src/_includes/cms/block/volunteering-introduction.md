{{# TODO Update this detail

This needs a bit more narrative to explain why volunteers are important to Bradford 2025
and what we’re asking them to do otherwise we’re just reducing it to numbers.

The first para needs to be clearer as it says getting them ready to volunteer during
2025 but they volunteered in Aug/Sept 2024 and in the box it lists 229 shifts.

{{# TODO UPDATE COPY ON VOLUNTEERING #}}

Volunteers are going to help Bradford 2025 deliver an incredible year of culture. There are many ways to get involved.

We're appointing ambassadors for one of Bradford’s diverse neighbourhoods – from Bingley to Barkerend, Ilkley to Idle, Keighley to Clayton. Volunteers will act as the friendly faces of Bradford 2025, meeting and greeting the public at our events. Some of our volunteers will be helping out behind the scenes, making sure our events run smoothly.
