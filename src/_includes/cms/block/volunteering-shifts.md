With the Giraffe event in August 2024, the Bradford 2025 volunteers have already made a start on their important job. The charts below show the numbers of shifts completed and hours contributed by the volunteers. They're going to be busy supporting the Bradford 2025 events, and will also be lending their skills to events run by our partners.

In the charts below <q>shifts</q> means total number of shifts completed by individual volunteers.
If 20 volunteers attend a single event, that would be reported as 20 shifts.
If each of these 20 volunteers spent 4 hours volunteering at the event, that would add 80 hours to the total.
