description: Includes work with schools but not only schools.

We should avoid using school specific terminology in any of our communications or activity packs designed for use by the wider education network. This is to ensure that home educators and alternative providers feel included, and that the cultural learning offer is for them as well as schools.  

For more infoâ€™ please see our Cultural Learning glossary: [Cultural Learning Glossary.docx](https://bradfordculture2025.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/EWEgoc5t3e1MkFl4ttRB4_IBRH9EvCfQcfkjWp7BU7XGrQ?e=fzgq4w&isSPOFile=1)

Includes:

* Schools  
* Home Educators and Home Educators Networks  
* Alternative providers
