title: Engagement (regular/frequent) 
description: Arts Council England (ACE) define frequent engagement as at least 3 to 4 times a year or more (this could be any combination of cultural events/ activities).

Data on levels of ‘engagement’ collected via our household survey will be aligned, when possible, with national survey definitions to enable ongoing monitoring and benchmarking at a population level. 

We will use the terms Audience and Participant in preference to ‘engagement’ to avoid any ambiguity and double counting and to define more clearly how people have engaged with Bradford 2025 events and activities. 

However, the term engagement can be used in a generic way to capture all of the different ways that we have engaged with different groups of participants and different audiences.
