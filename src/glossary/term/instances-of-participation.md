title: Instances of Participation
description: A measurement of ‘depth’ of participation.
---

One instance of participation is up to 2 hours.

We would keep this to the lowest whole number of ‘events’

For instance, if a person partipated for one hour on Monday and one hour on Tuesday that is 2 instances of participation.
