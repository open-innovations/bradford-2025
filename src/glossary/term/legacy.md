Note that individual projects will contribute only in a small way to some of the longer-term impacts.

Some key outcome and impact indicators will be collected longer term by our evaluation partners.

This includes:
* Some of the outcome indicators collected via our Economic and Social Value Impact Assessment. 
* District-wide impacts of the 10-year Culture is our Plan (CIOP) Strategy (of which Bradford 2025 designation was one ambition) are being monitored by BMDC.

This does not include activity and output measures.
