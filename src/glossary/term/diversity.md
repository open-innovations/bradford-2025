title: Diversity  
description: Diversity is understanding that each person is unique. It means embracing people’s differences, including their beliefs, abilities, preferences, backgrounds, values, and identities.

**Equality, Diversity and Inclusion** are often grouped and talked about together but they are not interchangeable terms. 

To help us to demonstrate whether we are working with, engaging with and reaching diverse stakeholders, audiences and participants, where possible and with people’s informed consent, we will collect data on protected characteristics and postcode. This means we will try to collect data on age, gender, ethnic group, sexual orientation, religion, disability, socio-economic and carer status.   

Collecting postcodes enables us to identify Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) which enables us to identify **ward** (there are 30 wards in Bradford district) and **IMD** quintile or decile.  

Standardised questions to ask when collecting **protected characteristics** data are available from the Evaluation Team.
