Events can be sub-divided into public events or school/ community events, performances, etc. 

Each day of an exhibition = an event. 

Each performance with a new audience cohort = an event  

This includes: 

* Workshops with public/communities, Performances, Performances within Festival programmes (e.g. Common Wealth and BD is Lit) 
* Exhibitions – public events programme,  
* Festivals – count events within the overall festival 
* Open/public rehearsals 

Problem of definition here: It seems as though events are being used to refer to both the containing event (e.g. Rise) and instances (e.g. Rise Friday performance).
Need to define this more tightly.
