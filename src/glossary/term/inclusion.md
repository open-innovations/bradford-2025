Equality, Diversity and Inclusion are often grouped and talked about together but they are not interchangeable terms.

Bradford 2025 supports the use of inclusive definitions and language. For example, the term ‘global majority’ will be used to refer to all ethnic groups except white British and other white groups. The term includes people from Black, Asian, mixed and other ethnic groups who are often called ‘ethnic minorities’.
