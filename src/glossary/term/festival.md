Bradford 2025 will not directly fund the running costs/general programme of festivals that already exist in the district. However, we will support new work through our commissions and call-outs that might take place within a festival.  

This includes:

* We may commission work that enhances BD is Lit and Proud Bradford (for example). 
* Contains Strong Language 

This does not include

* Local events e.g. Intercultured Festival unless they are awarded a commission or grant for a particular (new) part of their programme.
