Equality, Diversity and Inclusion are often grouped and talked about together but they are not interchangeable terms. 

It's also useful to understand what equity means. Equity means offering rights and opportunities fairly, catering to peopleâ€™s differences so they are given fair access to opportunities. It means providing various levels of support depending on specific needs or abilities.
