title: Global Majority
description: >-
  This is used to refer to all ethnic groups except white British and other
  white groups. The term includes people from Black, Asian, mixed and other
  ethnic groups who are often racialised as 'ethnic minorities'.

Global majority as a term better reflects reality. People in this part of the population make up 85% of the worldâ€™s population.  

Moving from classing people as a minority to a majority is an important step in reframing conversations from disadvantage to advantage and challenging existing dominant white-centric narratives.
