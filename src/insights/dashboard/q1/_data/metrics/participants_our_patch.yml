  Our Patch is Bradford 2025â€™s major programme of events and activities in and
  for communities. It is led by the Our Patch Producers, who will be joined on
  their patch by artists, makers, performers and creators, all experts in
  bringing people together. They will be inviting residents in every corner of
  the district to experience the twin joys of making art and taking part.
