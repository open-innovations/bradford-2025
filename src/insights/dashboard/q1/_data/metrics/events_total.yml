  An event is an instance with a defined start and end date and time. Events can
  be public events or school/community events, performances, public rehearsals,
  etc.


  Each day of an exhibition is counted as a separate event. Each performance
  with a new audience cohort is counted as a separate event.


  This is a work-in-progress. Data for events delivered by partner or
  commissioned organisations is less readily available. Some events are not yet
  included e.g. BFI film programme.


  Some of these figures are not complete for March 2025 e.g. Extraordinary
  Portraits data is up to {{ comp.Date({'start':'2025-03-23'}) }} and Nationhood
  data is up to {{ comp.Date({'start':'2025-03-17'}) }}.
