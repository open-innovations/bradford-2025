  An event is an instance with a defined start and end date and time. Events can
  be public events or school/community events, performances, public rehearsals,
  etc.


  Each day of an exhibition is counted as a separate event. Each performance
  with a new audience cohort is counted as a separate event.


  Data for events delivered by partner or commissioned organisations is less
  readily available than events delivered direct by Bradford 2025.
