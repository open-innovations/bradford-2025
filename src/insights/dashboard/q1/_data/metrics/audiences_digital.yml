  Digital audiences are those who experience a creative product designed to be
  experienced through digital technology or a digital platform e.g. through a
  'virtual' tour or by downloading an app.


  Website and social media users and streaming audiences are also classed as
  digital audiences and will be identified separately.


  Some Bradford 2025 projects include both in-person and digital elements. In
  these projects, the in-person and digital audience numbers will be counted
  separately.
