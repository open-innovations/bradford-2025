title: Audience
description: >
  This includes all audiences (as distinct from 'participants')


  The figure reported on the dashboard shows tickets sold for Bradford 2025
  events.

  This will over-estimate the actual audiences as not all tickets will be used.

  We have added initial processing of ticket scans to provide a more accurate
  estimate of ticketed audiences, although this has not been validated yet.

  More information about tickets can be found on the [ticketing data theme
  page](/themes/ticketing/).


  We are currently working on automated data processing for the following
  audiences. These will be added as they become available:


  * **Our Patch** (community engagements)

  * **Cultural Learning** (schools and other educational settings programme)

  * **Partner or commissioned organisations ticketed events** (e.g. National
  Science and Media Museums, Bradford Museums and Galleries, Impressions
  Gallery). Details about these will be obtained from the host organisations.

  * **Non-ticketed event** audience numbers will be counted or estimated using
  different methods. We are using or are planning to use a range of methods for
  counting these audiences, including clicker counters, footfall sensors, AI
  sensors, cameras, drones, and modelled estimates.
