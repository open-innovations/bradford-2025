description: "This includes all audiences (as distinct from 'participants')\r\n\r\nThe figure reported on the dashboard currently only includes tickets sold for Bradford 2025 events.\r\nNote that not all tickets will be used.\r\nWe will be adding processing of ticket scans to provide a more accurate estimate of ticketed audiences.\r\nMore information about tickets can be found on the the [ticketing data theme page](/themes/ticketing/).\r\n\r\nWe are currently working on reliable data processing for the following audiences. These will be added as they become reliable:\r\n\r\n* Ticketed events organised by partner or commissioned organisations (e.g. National Science and Media Musems, Bradford Museums and Galleries, Impressions Gallery). These will be obtained from the host organisations.\r\n* Audience numbers for non-ticketed events will be counted or estimated using different methods (e.g. clicker counters, footfall sensors, AI sensors, cameras, drones, modelled estimates).\r\n"
