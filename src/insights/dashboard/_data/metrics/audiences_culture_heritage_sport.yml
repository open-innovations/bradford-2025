  This includes all audiences (as distinct from 'participants') 

  Audience numbers for Bradford 2025 ticketed events will be obtained from Spektrix (tickets sold and tickets scanned). A prototype 'ticketing' dashboard has been developed [link] 

  Audience numbers for ticketed events organised by partner or commissioned organisations (e.g. NSMM, BDMG, Impressions Gallery) will be obtained from host organisations.

  Audience numbers for non-ticketed events will be counted or estimated using different methods (e.g. clicker counters, footfall sensors, AI sensors, cameras, drones, modelled estimates).

  Total ticket sales to date = X and for events in Q1 (Jan-Mar) = X

  Total tickets scanned to date = X and for events in Q1 (Jan-Mar)
