description: "This includes all audiences (as distinct from 'participants')\r\n\r\nThe figure reported on the dashboard currently only includes tickets sold for Bradford 2025 events.\r\nThis will over-estimate the actual audiences as not all tickets will be used.\r\nWe will be adding processing of ticket scans to provide a more accurate estimate of ticketed audiences.\r\nMore information about tickets can be found on the the [ticketing data theme page](/themes/ticketing/).\r\n\r\nWe are currently working on automated data processing for the following audiences. These will be added as they become available:\r\n\r\n* **Our Patch** (community engagements)\r\n* **Cultural Learning** (schools and other educational settings programme)\r\n* **Partner or commissioned organisations ticketed events** (e.g. National Science and Media Museums, Bradford Museums and Galleries, Impressions Gallery). Details about these will be obtained from the host organisations.\r\n* **Non-ticketed event** audience numbers will be counted or estimated using different methods. We are using or are planning to use a range of methods for counting these audiences, including clicker counters, footfall sensors, AI sensors, cameras, drones, and modelled estimates.\r\n"
