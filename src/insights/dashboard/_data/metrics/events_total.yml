  An event is an instance with a defined start and end date and time. Events can
  be public events or school/community events, performances, public rehearsals,
  etc.


  Each day of an exhibition is counted as a separate event. Each performance
  with a new audience cohort is counted as a separate event.


  This is a work-in-progress. There are some events which are not yet included
  as figures were not available e.g. BFI.


  Some of these figures are not complete until March 2025 e.g. Extraordinary
  Portraits data to {{ comp.Date({'start':'2025-03-23'}) }} and Nationhood to {{
  comp.Date({'start':'2025-03-17'}) }}
