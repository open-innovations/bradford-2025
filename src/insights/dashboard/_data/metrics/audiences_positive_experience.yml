title: Positive experience
flash: WIP
actual: 91
description: >-
  Percentage of survey respondents who rate their overall experience of an event
  as excellent or good.


  Audience experience surveys are emailed to people who have bought a ticket and
  have agreed to being emailed for marketing purposes. The surveys can also be
  accessed via a QR code at some event locations. A sample of audiences will be
  surveyed using face-to-face interviews undertaken by Spirul (an independent
  Market Research Company) or Bradford 2025 Evaluation Volunteers.


  The satisfaction question is included at the start of the survey and
  respondents have the option to complete a mini survey only or complete the
  longer full survey. Response rates are monitored on an ongoing basis.


  Additional indicators of ‘positive experience’ include a ‘what three words?’
  question, a Net Promoter Score and free text comments.
