title: Audience
description: >-
  This figure shows the current best estimate for audiences, both ticketed and
  non-ticketed.


  Please note that *tickets sold* does not necessarily reflect the true number
  of attendees but it provides the most reliable count of audience numbers at
  ticketed events across the Bradford 2025 programme. Bradford 2025 will also be
  collecting and analysing data on *tickets scanned*. At present, this data is
  less reliable and not readily available from partner or commissioned
  organisations.
