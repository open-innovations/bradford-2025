title: Audience
description: >
  This is a work-in-progress. It includes all audiences (as distinct from
  'participants')


  The figure reported on the dashboard shows tickets sold for Bradford 2025
  events. More information about tickets can be found on the [ticketing data
  theme page](/themes/ticketing/).


  Total audience includes:


  * **Our Patch** (community engagements)

  * **Cultural Learning** (schools and other educational settings programme)

  * **Partner or commissioned organisations ticketed events** (e.g. National
  Science and Media Museums, Bradford Museums and Galleries, Impressions
  Gallery). Details about these will be obtained from the host organisations.

  * **Non-ticketed event** audience numbers will be counted or estimated using
  different methods. We are using or are planning to use a range of methods for
  counting these audiences, including clicker counters, footfall sensors, AI
  sensors, cameras, drones, and modelled estimates.
