title: Audience
description: >-
  This is a work-in-progress. It includes all audiences (as distinct from
  'participants')


  The figure reported on the dashboard does not yet reflect the full audience
  number. It includes tickets sold for Bradford 2025 events, tickets sold for
  some of the events delivered by partner/ commissioned organisations and
  audience numbers for Bradford 2025 non-ticketed events (e.g. exhibitions).
  More information about Bradford 2025 ticket sales can be found on the
  [ticketing data theme page](/themes/ticketing/).


  The total audience figure will comprise:


  * **Bradford 2025 ticket sales** - Audience numbers for Bradford 2025 ticketed
  events is obtained from Spektrix. 

  * **Partner or commissioned organisations ticketed events** (e.g. National
  Science and Media Museums, Bradford Museums and Galleries, Impressions
  Gallery). Data will be obtained from the host organisations.

  * **Non-ticketed event audience** numbers counted by Bradford 2025 or provided
  by partner/ commissioned organisations. Audience numbers for non-ticketed
  events delivered by Bradford 2025 will be counted or estimated using a range
  of methods being developed and implemented with partner organisations. These
  methods include clicker counters, footfall sensors, AI sensors, cameras,
  drones, and modelled estimates from mobile phone data and other footfall
  counting methods. The counting method will be shown alongside audience
  numbers.


  Please note that ‘tickets sold’ does not necessarily reflect the true number
  of attendees but it provides the most reliable count of audience numbers at
  ticketed events across the Bradford 2025 programme. Bradford 2025 will also be
  collecting and analysing data on ‘tickets scanned’. However, this data is less
  reliable and not readily available from partner/ commissioned organisations.
