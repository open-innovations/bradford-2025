title: Audience
description: >-
  This figure shows the current best estimate for audiences, both ticketed and
  non-ticketed.


  Please note that *tickets sold* does not necessarily reflect the true number
  of attendees but it provides the most reliable count of audience numbers at
  ticketed events across the Bradford 2025 programme. Bradford 2025 will also be
  collecting and analysing data on *tickets scanned*. At present, this data is
  less reliable and not readily available from partner or commissioned
  organisations.

  - row: Outdoor arts
    description: >-
      This is an estimate of audience for outdoor public arts such as the Tower
      of Now and Ramadan Pavilion. Data is not yet available for most of these.
  - row: In-person
    description: >-
      Any audience which is not covered by a more specific category is counted
      as an "in-person" audience.
  - row: UNKNOWN
    description: >-
      This counts audiences for which the category is not known. At the moment,
      this is mostly audiences derived from Spektrix ticket sales, which do not
      have a clear categorisation.
