flash: WIP
description: Combination of stalls/events/performances of multiple art forms usually over a limited time period e.g. Contains Strong Language. Bradford 2025 will not directly fund the running costs/general programme of festivals that already exist in the district. However, we will support new work through our commissions and call-outs that might take place within a festival e.g. we may commission work that enhances BD is Lit or Proud Bradford.
