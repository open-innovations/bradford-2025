Audience data is gathered from several sources:

* **Project Hub &ndash; Schedule table (Airtable)** &mdash; audience recorded by the programme team
* **Ticketing data (Spektrix)** &mdash; tickets sold via Spektrix. NB _not tickets scanned_, so this might overcount the figures slightly.
* **Manually tracked data (spreadsheet)** &mdash; typically for events organised by third parties, but also used as a temporary source where the programme team has not yet had a chance to track data in Airtable.

The audience figures are a simple addition of the data in each source.

More information about Bradford 2025 ticket sales can be found on the [ticketing data monitoring page](/themes/ticketing/).
