# Building blocks

This directory is for visualisation building blocks that can be re-used elsewhere on the site.

Each one will be named in the style `_partials/block-n.vto` (where `n` is an incrementing number). The `block-n` ID will be displayed on _non-public_ pages so that we can easily reference each one. If a page is public, the header bar won't show up.
