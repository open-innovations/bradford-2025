2025-02-01,2025-04-29,88,"Feb – April 2025   Local choir Cultural Exchange   X4 choirs would be invited to explore songs of heritage: the definition of this just meaning songs of their heritage, folk songs, songs they remember from being children, songs they learnt from their parents, grandparents. Choir members would teach each other in their pairs. This is also an opportunity for them to share stories, the meanings behind the lyrics and learning a new language song.    Session 1 (x2) - meet their paired choir, introduce new song (s) including the sharing heritage stories/folk traditions/translating and learning new language lyrics - then go away to practice in own choirs   Session 2 (x2) - come back together to rehearse newly learned material and sing together   Session 3 - All 4 choirs come together to rehearse - putting together all the new learning into one cohesive performance, facilitated by the lead facilitator ",We Will Sing by Ann Hamilton at Salt's Mill,Jessica
