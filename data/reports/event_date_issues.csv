Choir members would teach each other in their pairs. This is also an opportunity for them to share stories, the meanings behind the lyrics and learning a new language song.    Session 1 (x2) - meet their paired choir, introduce new song (s) including the sharing heritage stories/folk traditions/translating and learning new language lyrics - then go away to practice in own choirs   Session 2 (x2) - come back together to rehearse newly learned material and sing together   Session 3 - All 4 choirs come together to rehearse - putting together all the new learning into one cohesive performance, facilitated by the lead facilitator ",We Will Sing by Ann Hamilton at Salt's Mill,2025-02-01 00:00:00+00:00,2025-04-29 23:00:00+00:00,"87 days, 23:00:00",Jessica,Event (any public-facing activity),Greenlit
